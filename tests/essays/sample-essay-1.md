To: Mr Duncan Goode
Date: 14 May 2025
Subject: Employment Tribunal Advice – Harassment and Unfair Dismissal Claims

Dear Mr Goode,

Thank you for contacting us in relation to your Employment Tribunal claim. This letter sets out our advice regarding the legal claims you are pursuing against Cann Abel Solicitors. As the hearing has not yet taken place, the purpose of this letter is to advise you on the relevant law and how it applies to your case. The remedies that may be available to you, the pros and cons of settling your claim and what to expect at the Tribunal hearing.

1. Summary of Key Facts

You were an employee of Cann Abel from 1 July 2022 to 16 September 2024. Originally as a trainee, you were then promoted to Assistant Solicitor on the 1st of July 2024. During your time in the Dispute Resolution team, you allege that your supervisor, Joanne Cann, engaged in unwanted physical contact and inappropriate comments.

Around the 21st of July and 27th of July 2024, Ms Cann touched you at work, rubbing your shoulders and neck, and referred to you as "Sweetie." On the 6th of August, she made another physical and suggestive comment, squeezing your arm and invited you to the pub, she said she wanted to "go out with a strong man." You made it clear you weren't interested and asked her to stop.

After this incident, you were on annual leave and so was Ms Cann. Upon her return on the 31st of August, she reviewed your cases and the next day you were suspended. You were later dismissed for alleged gross misconduct, including missing a limitation date and the failure to send client care letters. You believe this disciplinary action was due to your rejection of Ms Cann's behaviour and not genuine misconduct.

You are bringing claims for:
- Harassment related to sex
- Sexual harassment
- Less favourable treatment after rejecting sexual conduct
- Unfair dismissal

2. Harassment Related to Sex – Section 26(1) Equality Act 2010

Under section 26(1) of the Equality Act 2010, harassment occurs where a person engages in unwanted conduct related to sex, which has the purpose or effect of either violating your dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for you.

The touching of your shoulders and use of the name "Sweetie" could be reasonably viewed as unwanted conduct relating to sex. The law doesn't require the conduct to be sexual in nature and only that it is related to sex, which includes gendered language and assumptions.

It is important that the "effect" on you matters even if the intention was different. You've said how it made you feel uncomfortable and created an awkward and unwelcome environment, especially as it came from someone in a position of authority over you. This aligns with the approach taken in Driskel v Peninsula Business Services Ltd, where an overly familiar work environment became actionable harassment when it affected the claimant's dignity.

3. Sexual Harassment – Section 26(2) Equality Act 2010

This provision covers unwanted conduct of a sexual nature. Again, the effect of the behaviour is crucial. In your case, the physical contact, massaging, squeezing your biceps and suggestive comment about "going out with a strong man" all point clearly to sexualised conduct.

You made it clear you were uncomfortable, and the conduct continued. In Reed v Stedman, it was held that a single sexual comment could amount to harassment if it had the required effect. Here, the physical element combined with suggestive remarks is likely to be taken seriously by the Tribunal. The fact that Ms Cann was your supervisor strengthens the power imbalance and makes it more likely the conduct will be seen as unlawful.

4. Less Favourable Treatment – Section 26(3) Equality Act 2010

You also have a claim under section 26(3), which provides protection where someone is treated less favourably because they reject or submit to sexual conduct.

The key issue is whether your suspension and dismissal were influenced by your rejection of Ms Cann's advances. Although the employer may argue that you were dismissed for performance issues, the timing is highly suggestive: you were suspended the day after she returned from leave, following your rejection of her conduct.

In Hammond v International Network Services UK Ltd, the Tribunal accepted that post-rejection retaliation could be unlawful harassment if linked to the earlier sexual conduct. Similarly, in Moonsar v Fiveways Express Transport Ltd, the employer's actions following a rejection were held to be discriminatory.

5. Unfair Dismissal – Employment Rights Act 1996

Employees with two years' continuous service are protected from unfair dismissal under section 94 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. A dismissal will be fair if the employer had:
- A potentially fair reason (e.g., misconduct)
- Acted reasonably in treating that reason as sufficient (British Home Stores v Burchell test)

You admitted missing a deadline. But you were also denied the opportunity to explain the client care letters issue fully, and the process raises red flags:
- No clear particulars of the allegations
- You weren't allowed access to your files
- The presenter of the case was the very person whose conduct you had rejected

Tribunals expect impartial decision-making. Having Ms Cann lead the disciplinary case when she was the subject of your complaint is arguably a breach of natural justice.

You also mention a comparator who was not dismissed for similar mistakes. This could show inconsistency, and strengthen both your unfair dismissal and discrimination claims.

6. Remedies Available

If successful, you may be entitled to the following:

a. Discrimination Claims (Equality Act 2010)
- Injury to feelings (per Vento bands):
  - Band 1: £1,100 – £11,200 (less serious)
  - Band 2: £11,200 – £33,700 (mid-range)
  - Band 3: £33,700 – £56,200 (most serious)
- Financial losses (e.g. lost earnings since dismissal)
- Declaration of unlawful conduct
- Recommendation to prevent recurrence (e.g. training)

b. Unfair Dismissal (ERA 1996)
- Basic award (based on age and length of service)
- Compensatory award (lost income, future loss)
- Reinstatement or re-engagement – though rare

7. Settlement – Advantages and Disadvantages

A negotiated settlement (usually a COT3 agreement via ACAS) can be a practical alternative to a hearing.

Advantages:
- Faster and cheaper
- Less stressful than a public hearing
- Certainty over outcome
- Possibility of a neutral reference

Disadvantages:
- Usually a lower payout than a Tribunal award
- No public finding of fault
- You give up your right to pursue the claim

We can assist you in negotiating a fair figure, especially if you are open to a non-financial remedy like a reference.

8. What to Expect at the Tribunal

Employment Tribunals are less formal than courts but still structured. The panel usually includes:
- An Employment Judge
- Two lay members (employer/employee experience)

You'll give evidence, be cross-examined, and have a chance to put forward your case. The hearing is usually public, but in sensitive harassment cases, the Tribunal can make privacy directions.

Hearings typically last a few days. We'll support you in preparing your witness statement, evidence bundle, and submissions.

In our view, your claims are strong. The conduct complained of is serious and recent. The timing of the dismissal and procedural issues suggest your employer may not have acted fairly. Pursuing the claim is likely to result in either a successful Tribunal outcome or a reasonable settlement offer.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like us to initiate settlement discussions or prepare for hearing.

Task 2: Reflective Essay

Part A

This year has marked a big change for me, I moved countries and started university. If you looked at my phase 1 action plan and compared it to my phase 2, you will probably see two different versions of me. At the start I struggled with almost every aspect of teamwork in an academic setting. This was not because I didn't care, it was because I didn't know how to show up properly in an academic environment.

My ADHD played a big part of that. It's not just about getting distracted and losing focus. I also get energy crashes that come out of nowhere, periods where I have no motivation to get tasks done, and missed tasks and bad results that lead to guilt which make it even harder to re-engage. There were times when I really did want to engage properly with my firm, but mentally it was very difficult to do. It is very exhausting trying to mask that in a group environment where you're expected to switched on and competent.

On top of that, ADHD often comes with mood and an emotional rollercoaster. Some days I would be able to contribute and on other days id feel very out of place. That inconsistency made me second guess whether I should speak in meetings, even when I had something to say. The academic setting has never really been biggest strength. I'm very confident socially and quite load, but in an academic environment, that confidence goes away. It feels like I'm stepping into another world and I feel behind even if no one said it out loud.

In Phase 1, my attendance was very inconsistent to both firm meetings and lectures. I barely spoke and I avoided harder tasks. I would only take on work on work I was comfortable with. It wasn't entirely due to laziness, it was mainly a fear of letting the group down. Communication and cooperation were low because I felt like I had little to add. All of my self-assessment scores were pretty low for good reason.

I came to learn that improvement doesn't necessarily mean becoming the loudest or most dominant voice in the room but it was more about turning up, making small changes and building momentum. In phase 2 I started to do a bit more preparation before meetings, it was small but it was more than what I did before. This meant that I could contribute one small point without panicking and that did help. I spoke more and tried to push myself and do harder tasks. I still haven't reached my full potential but it was progress that I was proud of.

In terms of specific teamwork skills, communication, co-operation and delivery of work are where I noticed the biggest shift. Communication was definitely the most difficult. I really had to push myself to speak up even when my brain told me it wasn't worth it. But the more I did the less intimidating it became. Co-operation followed, once I started to participate I felt more included. And in terms of delivery I actually completed task that I otherwise would've avoided.

I think a lot of the progress I made come from accepting that it did not need to be perfect. According to Belbin's team role theory, good teams need a mix of personalities and skills, not just extroverted leaders. Belbin talks about the value of people that are good listeners and those that quietly make sure things get done.

To be completely honest there were still challenges. I still had to fight the struggles that come with ADHD like low motivation. I still left things too late, but by the end of phase 2 I had made progress in managing some of these struggles, especially by using structure and preparation to my advantage and that is something I plan to carry on doing.

So, going forward I have created a plan to try and follow:
1. Keep preparing beforehand for meeting, not necessarily hours of work but enough to walk in with something to say.
2. I will set small personal goals for group tasks, whether its volunteering to do something or helping someone else out.
3. Use my support plan more actively I must use the tools I've got access to for ADHD, and I need to use them rather than just brushing them of.
4. I will track my energy and pace myself to avoid going into dips and avoiding work overflow.

Finally, teamwork this year has taught me that I don't have to change who I am to be useful in a group. I just need to bring the best version of what I already have. That means playing to my strengths, being honest about my weak esses and finding ways to stay consistent even when my brain starts get distracted.

Part B

Negotiation was the most practical skill I developed over this term. I always associated negotiation with being very sharp and confrontational which I did not think I would be capable of achieving in an academic context, especially one I hadn't practiced before.

Going into it I didn't feel confident, I was unsure how to strike the balance between being professional and standing firm. ADHD didn't help that either, I found it very hard to prepare because would focus would drift and I would second guess myself. But once the exercise started, I was surprised by how much it wasn't about being aggressive, it was more about reading the room, staying calm and knowing when to push and when to take a step back, these are things that I am good at.

Something I did struggle with however, was the idea of anchoring. I was to quick to accept the first offer that was made and in hindsight I could've pushed harder. I didn't really test the "zone of possible agreement" because I didn't set a clear boundary beforehand. That is something I'd do differently. I got to see the value of knowing your limits before you walk into a room.

Still, there were positives. I was able to keep things respectful and constructive, which made the other side more open. According to Embley et al, good negotiation relies on preparation and adaptability, being able to respond in the moment and not just sticking to a script. I saw I didn't need to dominate, I just needed to listen, think and respond clearly.

Moving forward, I would like to further develop my confidence in making offers and setting clear goals before negotiating. I would also like to practice responding in real time through moots, and mock negotiations. But this really showed me that negotiation isn't about winning, its more about getting a result that works without escalating conflict.
