    "section_subtitle": "Common Questions",
    "section_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section_description": "Everything you need to know about MarkM8",
    "question1": "How does the AI grading work?",
    "answer1": "MarkM8 uses three independent AI models to grade your essay in parallel. Each model evaluates your work against your rubric, then we use consensus scoring to provide an accurate grade range. Outliers are automatically detected and excluded.",
    "question2": "Is my essay stored or shared?",
    "answer2": "No. Your essay is processed in real-time and immediately deleted after grading. We never store, share, or use your essays for AI training. Your academic work remains completely private.",
    "question3": "How accurate is the grading?",
    "answer3": "Our triple AI consensus approach provides grades that closely align with university standards. By using three models and excluding outliers, we achieve more reliable results than single-model systems.",
    "question4": "What types of essays can I submit?",
    "answer4": "MarkM8 works with any type of academic essay - argumentative, analytical, research papers, literature reviews, and more. Just paste your essay, assignment brief, and rubric for the most accurate results.",
    "question5": "How long does grading take?",
    "answer5": "Most essays are graded in under 3 minutes. Complex or longer essays may take up to 5 minutes. You'll see real-time status updates while your essay is being analyzed.",
    "question6": "What if I disagree with the grade?",
    "answer6": "You can regrade any essay using another credit. Each grading is independent, so you may get slightly different feedback. The grade range we provide accounts for natural variation in assessment."
