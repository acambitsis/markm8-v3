As grader 3 noted: \\\"This essay argues that technological innovation, rather than political reform, drove social change\\\" - this is specific and arguable.\\n\\n    2. **Effective Use of Evidence**: You demonstrate strong use of historical evidence, including quotations from historians and primary sources. The vivid description of factory conditions effectively draws readers in.\\n\\n    3. **Logical Structure**: The essay follows a logical argument structure with clear topic sentences in each paragraph, building points coherently.\\n\\n    ## Areas for Improvement (3-4 most actionable)\\n\\n    1. **Strengthen Transitions**: The transitions between sections need work, particularly the shift from economic to social analysis. Add a bridging paragraph or transitional phrases like \\\"Furthermore,\\\" \\\"In contrast,\\\" or \\\"Building on this economic foundation.\\\"\\n\\n    2. **Develop the Conclusion**: Your conclusion restates the thesis without synthesis and feels rushed. Expand it to discuss broader implications - why does this matter today?\\n\\n    3. **Address Counterarguments**: The essay does not address opposing viewpoints. Include a paragraph acknowledging and refuting alternative perspectives to strengthen your argument.\\n\\n    ## Language Tips\\n\\n    - Standardize citation formatting - currently mixing MLA and APA styles\\n    \", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"\\n    <grader_1 model=\\\"grok-4\\\" percentage=\\\"72\\\">\\n    Strengths:\\n    - Clear thesis statement: \\\"The essay opens with a well-defined thesis that guides the reader.\\\"\\n    - Good use of historical evidence with multiple primary sources cited.\\n\\n    Improvements:\\n    - Paragraph transitions need work.
