As grader 3 noted: \"This essay argues that technological innovation, rather than political reform, drove social change\" - this is specific and arguable.\n\n    2. **Effective Use of Evidence**: You demonstrate strong use of historical evidence, including quotations from historians and primary sources. The vivid description of factory conditions effectively draws readers in.\n\n    3. **Logical Structure**: The essay follows a logical argument structure with clear topic sentences in each paragraph, building points coherently.\n\n    ## Areas for Improvement (3-4 most actionable)\n\n    1. **Strengthen Transitions**: The transitions between sections need work, particularly the shift from economic to social analysis. Add a bridging paragraph or transitional phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"In contrast,\" or \"Building on this economic foundation.\"\n\n    2. **Develop the Conclusion**: Your conclusion restates the thesis without synthesis and feels rushed. Expand it to discuss broader implications - why does this matter today?\n\n    3. **Address Counterarguments**: The essay does not address opposing viewpoints. Include a paragraph acknowledging and refuting alternative perspectives to strengthen your argument.\n\n    ## Language Tips\n\n    - Standardize citation formatting - currently mixing MLA and APA styles\n    ", "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Prioritization [GEval]", "threshold": 0.6, "success": true, "score": 0.9, "reason": "The output demonstrates excellent prioritization of feedback.
